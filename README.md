AVR-Snake
=========

A simple Snake game to run on an AVR chip.

This solution is wired up to PixelToaster so that it draws in a window, mainly because I don't have 900 WS2811 pixels
to drive with an AVR.

Controls
========

- Arrow keys for direction
- The start screen has a bunch of gradient lines and diagonals
- Press the **up arrow** to begin a game
- When you see a green X covering the screen, you have lost
- No, there are no apples to eat... yet.
